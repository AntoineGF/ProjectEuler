# Project Euler

My attempt to solve some of the problems proposed by <a href = "https://projecteuler.net">ProjectEuler.net</a>.

## Organisation

The folder **python** contains the scripts written in Python.

The folder **src** contains Java scripts for the same problems.

First, I solve the problems in Python and based on my script, I try translating
it into Java, as an exercise.
